                    <br><p class="description_project">The Miller Park Zoo in Bloomington, Illinois holds a large fundraising gala every year called "ZooDo," and the former president of Illinois State University Larry Dietz reached out to the director of Design Streak Studio to request that students in Design Streak create the experience for the entire event. The theme we were given was South American festivals and celebrations, inspired by the two new animal additions to the zoo from South America.
                        <br>
                        <br>Throughout the project, I collaborated with my peers in Design Streak to develop the baseline branding of the event. We eventually settled on the name "ZooDo Zamboree" and designed an invitation, along with an RSVP card insert. The clients were invited to the Illinois State campus and we presented two options, after which they decided to move forward with the option I had worked on.
                        <br>
                        <br> The following summer, I accepted an internship with the art director of Design Streak in which I designed most of the remaining assets for the gala, including but not limited to a Save the Date postcard, table placemats, web and social media assets, raffle tickets, paper paw prints, hanging banners, signage around the zoo, and various table decorations. I also sat in on committee meetings with members of the Miller Park Zoo board, along with my director. During the Fall 2022 semester in the weeks leading up to the event, I collaborated with my peers in Design Streak once again to design menus, table number cards, and a program booklet.
